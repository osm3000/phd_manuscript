Papers I should read about style:
===============================================
Speech:

- all tacatron papers
*********
Self driving car?

- Start from the paper of Gerard
*********
Handwriting styles

- Sonia's papers
- Chinese handwriting

* Mention pytorch, scikit learn and the whole scipy stack. Solid engineering is the key for the future of science.
==============================================================================================
* Write a paper about the usage of ML in science, the pipeline, experimental and analysis protocol. Make it an ongoin-project. Allow people to share and modify this document.
==============================================================================================
# General issues:
* Unify the terminology of:
    - generated traces, letters, tracing, example, sequence (because right now, it is confusing)
    - ground truth, target,
* Replace all mention of 'bias' with 'condition'. Also, when talking about the letter/letter+writer bias, replace it with letter/writer identities.
* For the captions of the different figures, since there is a table of figures, create a short caption (which will appear in the table), while leaving the long caption intact.
* In SEAT chapter, add diagrams explaining the transfer learning in the SOTA section
* Replace the word crossentropy with loglikelihood
* Provide the p-values for the cross entropy (small table addition)
* Mention that we are using the max size of data on the target task (much stronger evidence about the quality of transfer learning, that even with the max advatnage available to the baseline model, we still perform better).
* In the different tables, highlight the good results! to make it easier to find!!
